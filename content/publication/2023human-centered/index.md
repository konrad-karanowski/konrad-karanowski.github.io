abstract: Some tasks in content processing, e.g., natural language processing (NLP), like hate or offensive speech and emotional or funny text detection, are subjective by nature. Each human may perceive some content individually. The existing reasoning methods commonly rely on agreed output values, the same for all recipients. We propose fundamentally different — personalized solutions applicable to any subjective NLP task. Our five new deep learning models take into account not only the textual content but also the opinions and beliefs of a given person. They differ in their approaches to learning Human Bias (HuBi) and fusion with content (text) representation. The experiments were carried out on 14 tasks related to offensive, emotional, and humorous texts. Our personalized HuBi methods radically outperformed the generalized ones for all NLP problems. Personalization also has a greater impact on reasoning quality than commonly explored pre-trained and fine-tuned language models. We discovered a high correlation between human bias calculated using our dedicated formula and that learned by the model. Multi-task solutions achieved better outcomes than single-task architectures. Human and word embeddings also provided additional insights.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper introduces personalized deep learning models for subjective tasks in natural language processing (NLP), such as detecting hate speech, emotional text, and humor. These models consider individual opinions and beliefs, significantly outperforming generalized approaches across 14 NLP tasks. The study finds that personalized Human Bias (HuBi) methods greatly enhance reasoning quality, with multi-task solutions proving more effective than single-task ones, while human and word embeddings offer supplementary insights.
