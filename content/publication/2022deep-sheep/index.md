abstract: 'As humans, we experience a wide range of feelings and reactions. One of these is laughter, often related to a personal sense of humor and the perception of funny content. Due to its subjective nature, recognizing humor in NLP is a very challenging task. Here, we present a new approach to the task of predicting humor in the text by applying the idea of a personalized approach. It takes into account both the text and the context of the content receiver. For that purpose, we proposed four Deep-SHEEP learning models that take advantage of user preference information differently. The experiments were conducted on four datasets: Cockamamie, HUMOR, Jester, and Humicroedit. The results have shown that the application of an innovative personalized approach and user-centric perspective significantly improves performance compared to generalized methods. Moreover, even for random text embeddings, our personalized methods outperform the generalized ones in the subjective humor modeling task. We also argue that the user-related data reflecting an individual sense of humor has similar importance as the evaluated text itself. Different types of humor were investigated as well.'
