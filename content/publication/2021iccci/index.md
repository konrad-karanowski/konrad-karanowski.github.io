abstract: 'In this study, we introduce a morphological analysis of segmented tumour cells from histopathology images concerning the recognition of cell overlapping. The main research problem considered is to distinguish how many cells are located in a structure, which is composed of overlapping cells. In our experiments, we used convolutional neural network models to provide recognition of the number of cells. For the medical data used: Ki-67 histopathology images, we achieved a high f1-score result. Therefore, our research proves the assumption to use convolutional neural networks for morphological analysis of segmented objects derived from medical images.'
