To date, there has been no study that describes a multiclass model, medically accurate, and trained on large diverse dataset. No study has addressed a class imbalance problem in one giant dataset originating from multiple large diverse eye fundus image collections. To ensure a real-life clinical environment and mitigate the problem of biased medical image data, 22 publicly available datasets were merged. To secure medical validity only Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Glaucoma (GL) were included. The state-of-the-art models ConvNext, RegNet and ResNet were utilized. In the resulting dataset, there were 86,415 normal, 3787 GL, 632 AMD and 34,379 DR fundus images. ConvNextTiny achieved the best results in terms of recognizing most of the examined eye diseases with the most metrics. The overall accuracy was 80.46 ± 1.48. Specific accuracy values were: 80.01 ± 1.10 for normal eye fundus, 97.20 ± 0.66 for GL, 98.14 ± 0.31 for AMD, 80.66 ± 1.27 for DR. A suitable screening model for the most prevalent retinal diseases in ageing societies was designed. The model was developed on a diverse, combined large dataset which made the obtained results less biased and more generalizable.","tags":["Computer Vision","AI in Medicine"],"title":"Counteracting Data Bias and Class Imbalance—Towards a Useful and Reliable Retinal Disease Recognition System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcin Sendera","Marcin Przewięźlikowski","Jan Miksa","Mateusz Rajski","Konrad Karanowski","Maciej Zięba","Jacek Tabor","Przemysław Spurek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1684800000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684800000,"objectID":"0452e79d145307dae03d436d40c3de5d","permalink":"https://konrad-karanowski.com/publication/2023general-few-shot/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023general-few-shot/","section":"publication","summary":"The general framework for few-shot learning via kernel HyperNetworks—the fusion of kernels and hypernetwork paradigm is proposed, and it is shown that incorporating Bayesian neural networks into the general framework, an approach called BayesHyperShot, solves this issue.","tags":["few-shot learning","meta learning","computer vision"],"title":"The general framework for few-shot learning by kernel HyperNetworks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Tabakov","Krzysztof Galus","Artur Zawisza","Adam R.

We focused on the problem of cell counting in cell conglomerates, which are considered as structures composed of overlapping tumor cells. The lack of large and standardized data sets is a critical problem in medical image classification. Classical augmentation procedures are not sufficient. Therefore, in this research, we expanded our previous augmentation approach for histopathology images and we proved the possibility to apply it for a cell-counting problem.","tags":["Computer Vision","AI in medicine"],"title":"Synthetic Data Generation for Morphological Analyses of Histopathology Images with Deep Learning Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Przemysław Kazienko","Julita Bielaniewicz","Marcin Gruza","Kamil Kanclerz","Konrad Karanowski","Piotr Miłkowski","Jan Kocoń"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1673568000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673568000,"objectID":"7a0d01371d11ae6b25d4a835b1d46ce2","permalink":"https://konrad-karanowski.com/publication/2023human-centered/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023human-centered/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper introduces personalized deep learning models for subjective tasks in natural language processing (NLP), such as detecting hate speech, emotional text, and humor.

However, there are many subjective problems that should respect users’ individual points of view. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate three different personalized methods for the task of hate speech detection. Our user-centered techniques are compared to the generalizing baseline approach. We conduct our experiments on three datasets including single-task and multi-task hate speech detection. For validation purposes, we introduce a new data split strategy, which prevents data leakage between training and testing. To better understand the behavior of the model for individual users, we carried out personalized ablation studies. Our experiments revealed that all models leveraging user preferences in any case provide significantly better results than most frequently used generalized approaches. This supports our general observation that personalized models should always be considered in all subjective NLP tasks, including hate speech detection.","tags":["NLP","Personalized NLP"],"title":"What if Ground Truth is Subjective?
